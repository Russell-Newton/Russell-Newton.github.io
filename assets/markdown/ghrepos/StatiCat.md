A custom Discord bot developed in Nextcord, a Python wrapper of the Discord API.

Created a custom wrapper for Interaction webhooks, unique from regular commands, including:
* Decorators with at-runtime registration and reloading of Application Commands.
* Automatic selection of subclasses for command parsing and handling via overloaded object creation.
